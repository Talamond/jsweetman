We built it using Sencha Touch and IBM Worklight. Technically speaking, Concert Mobile was a Native Application on both Andriod and iOS but the fact is, all the native code did was run a WebView, so it was essentially a mobile web app.  Most the development couldn't be considered native, but there was still a bit of native work for things like the WebViews and our login process.

The Core was a web application that hosted all the other applications in iframes and provided mechanisms of communication using primarily Web Api's postMessage.
