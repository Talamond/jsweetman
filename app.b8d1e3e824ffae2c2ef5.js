I was one of the first three to join the team and worked as the sole UI Developer on Symon.AI for the next 2 years, until its acquisition by Varicent Inc in 2020. My responsibilities included working with design to provide optimum user experience, planning API requirements and implementing all the UI.",descriptions:{SymonAI:"Symon.AI is best described as a machine learning pipeline. Essentially, you import data from a variety of sources (csv, GSheets, Google Ads, Google Analytics, Shopify) and apply transformations to create predictive models. The data can be viewed at any phase of the transformations and be used to make charts, similar to Excel. There are over 50 different tools you can use to transform your data and a page dedicated to laying them out. The frontend is built using React, Redux, Typescript and PostCSS."},details:["Built and architected Symon.AI’s UI from nothing as the sole UI developer","Worked with designers to implement optimum UX experience","Developed coding standards, boilerplates, component libraries and all application features","Integrated with Sentry and LogRocket to provide a seamless experience finding and debugging application issues"],type:"full",color:"#3498DB",skills:[{label:"React",weight:100},{label:"Redux",weight:100},{label:"Typescript",weight:100},{label:"CSS",weight:50},{label:"PostCSS",weight:70},{label:"Webpack",weight:50},{label:"rxjs",weight:60},{label:"Yarn",weight:30},{label:"Git",weight:20},{label:"Jest",weight:50},{label:"Zeplin",weight:30}],image:"../../jsweetman/assets/images/symon_logo.svg"},{id:13,startDate:d("2020-01-01"),endDate:d("2021-03-01"),title:"Senior UI Developer",employer:"Varicent",description:"After the acquisition by Varicent, I continued to work on Symon.AI's UI. We scaled up in size and I led the new frontend developers as they became up to speed on Symon.AI. We succeeded our goals in getting at least 10 clients for Symon.AI by the end of our first year. Our team supports our clients on a daily basis using various integrations I am responsible for setting up (e.g. Sentry, Logrocket, Intercom, Upscope and WalkMe). Sentry lets us know when clients encounter bugs. Logrocket helps developers reproduce bugs found by QA/clients. Intercom and Upscope are used as a way for clients to contact support and WalkMe provides education and tutorials on how to use Symon.AI. Symon.AI continues to grow as we're finding new ways to attract clients.",descriptions:{SymonAI:"Symon.AI continues to evolve. We built Apps within Symon where users can easily plugin their data to generate infographics that share statistics and predictions of their data. I designed and built the Explain Waterfall visualization, which shows users which columns in their data are most impactful. We implemented more import connectors including SalesForce, Excel and various database connectors. I also conducted user experiments that put the UX to the test. Users were given a set of tasks to complete and we recorded their attempts. Using the recordings, I proposed and implemented better UX, which resulted in the next set of users having an improved success rate.
